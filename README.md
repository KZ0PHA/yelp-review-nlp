## Key Features of NLPalate
- Generating WordClouds of frequently-mentioned keywords in reviews of reference's restaurant compared with competitors within the same categories in the same city using unsupervised learning algorithm -- term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (tf-idf)
- Displaying the Top 5 Complaints and Top 5 Compliments that are affecting each restaurant
- Finding the 30 most prevalent topics in all reviews, through topic modelling using Latent Dirichlect Allocation (LDA), and unsupervised machine learning algorithm
- Performing Linear regression to map which topics and having the biggest impact on a restaurant's review score
- Aiding restaurant owners by providing focused and easily digestible recommendations/ suggestions based on the issues/ complaints they received using OpenAI's API
